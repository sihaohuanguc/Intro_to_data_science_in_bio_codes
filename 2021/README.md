# Description
This repository is the notes I took when taking the **Introduction to Data Science in Biochemistry and Biophysics** course given by Prof. Ronald Rock. Most of them are R Markdown files of the codes and comments in the course. 

There might be some updates next year when I'm doing the TA for this course.

# Softwares
The `.Rmd` files were written with RStudio. The `README.md` file was written with Visual Studio Code.

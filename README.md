# Description
## 2022
I'm doing the TA for the course **Introduction to Data Science in Biochemistry and Biophysics** this year. The notes about the lectures are in the `Lecture_code_practice` folder and the notes about the live coding sessions are in the `live_coding_sessions` folder. 

## 2021
This repository is the notes I took when taking the **Introduction to Data Science in Biochemistry and Biophysics** course given by Prof. Ronald Rock. Most of them are R Markdown files of the codes and comments in the course. 

# Software
The `.Rmd` files were written with RStudio. The `README.md` file was written with Visual Studio Code.
